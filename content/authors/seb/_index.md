He researches computational approaches to musical learning and memory, with a particular emphasis on learning melodies and playing by ear. He is an active music teacher and saxophonist, improviser and composer, most notably with the band [Don’t Problem](https://dontproblem.com/) (see music website [here](https://www.sebsilasmusic.com)). He draws upon his experience in these fields in his academic research.

He maintains the [musicassessr](https://github.com/sebsilas/musicassessr) and [itembankr](https://github.com/sebsilas/itembankr) R packages and musical ability tests: 
- [Playing By Ear Test (PBET)](https://github.com/sebsilas/PBET)
- [Singing Ability Assessment (SAA)](https://github.com/sebsilas/SAA)
- [Sight Reading Test (SRT)](https://github.com/sebsilas/SRT)
- [Sight Singing Test (SST)](https://github.com/sebsilas/SST)
- [Pitch Discrimination Test (PDT)](https://github.com/sebsilas/PDT)
